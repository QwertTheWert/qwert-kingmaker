It has two massive tusks, which it uses to gore prey and tangle with rival slurks. With the slurk's natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of the beast's formidable ivory tusks.</p>\n<p>Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk's back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster's other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk's ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals.</p>\n<p>Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this apparent failure, slurks are often befriended by others who live underground. The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds, who now domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks. Kobold riders also take advantage of the slurk's ability to climb, and charge at their enemies from the walls of a

They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll's endless hunger drives it to consume all variety of living creatures, and it is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls' legendary regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls' capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand-a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures' power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll's vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though-even the smallest scrap of a troll's flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster's entire body until nothing remains.</p>\n<p>Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \"troll kings\" possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well-mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous-but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["giant","troll"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["jotun"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":-2},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.gvCCATlH9mPGWbsp"}},"effects":[],"folder":"Nbx67N4hiw8FSZUX","sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"ISBIyuMkNnXbaRpd":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675897560120,"modifiedTime":1676195787722,"lastModifiedBy":"ISBIyuMkNnXbaRpd"},"_id":"wuseb8UsU1v4cWuy"},{"prototypeToken":{"displayName":30,"displayBars":0,"flags":{"barbrawl":{"resourceBars":{"bar1":{"order":0,"id":"bar1","attribute":"attributes.hp","mincolor":"#FF0000","maxcolor":"#80FF00","position":"bottom-inner","otherVisibility":50,"ownerVisibility":50,"gmVisibility":-1,"hideFull":false,"hideEmpty":false,"hideCombat":false,"hideNoCombat":true,"indentLeft":null,"indentRight":null,"shareHeight":false,"style":"none","label":"","invert":false,"subdivisions":null,"subdivisionsOwner":false,"fgImage":"","bgImage":"","opacity":null}}},"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true,"autoscale":true}},"name":"Kobold Scout","actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/bestiary-tokens/humanoid/small/kobold-scout.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"randomImg":false},"img":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/bestiary-portraits/humanoid/small/kobold-scout.webp","items":[{"_id":"5IzoN6IwHOIwWFf6","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.62nnVQvGhoVLLl2K"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/crossbow.webp","name":"Crossbow","sort":100000,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>This ranged weapon has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame called a tiller.

They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.</p>\n<p>Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds' innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no matter how brutal they might be to their kobold

They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.</p>\n<p>Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds' innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can.

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.</p>\n<p>Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for-or perhaps to summon-intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.</p>\n<p>Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \"spore mounds,\" discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and inflict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["plant"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["common","elven","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":"(Can't Speak Any Language)"},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-2},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.6XlGTt3RveX49YbC"}},"effects":[],"folder":"wtBBUnc37guCCq6Y","sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"ISBIyuMkNnXbaRpd":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675896525391,"modifiedTime":1676195787742,"lastModifiedBy":"ISBIyuMkNnXbaRpd"},"_id":"Gn6g9SZ9dOO2OWUH"},{"prototypeToken":{"displayName":30,"displayBars":50,"flags":{"barbrawl":{"resourceBars":{"bar1":{"order":0,"id":"bar1","attribute":"attributes.hp","mincolor":"#FF0000","maxcolor":"#80FF00","position":"bottom-inner","otherVisibility":50,"ownerVisibility":50,"gmVisibility":-1,"hideFull":false,"hideEmpty":false,"hideCombat":false,"hideNoCombat":true,"indentLeft":null,"indentRight":null,"shareHeight":false,"style":"none","label":"","invert":false,"subdivisions":null,"subdivisionsOwner":false,"fgImage":"","bgImage":"","opacity":null}}},"pf2e":{"autoscale":false,"linkToActorSize":true}},"name":"Skeletal Champion","actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/bestiary-tokens/undead/skeletal/skeletal-champion.webp","scaleX":1.5,"scaleY":1.5,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"randomImg":false},"img":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/bestiary-portraits/undead/skeletal/skeletal-champion.webp","items":[{"_id":"aB660wS9natXTx40","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.OPMzQdM9rZznMGhW"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/lance.webp","name":"Lance","sort":100000,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>This spear‑like weapon is used by a mounted creature to deal a great deal of damage.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"lance","schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":0},"traits":{"value":["deadly-d8","jousting-d6","reach"],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[],"custom":""},"quantity":1,"baseItem":"lance","hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"2"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{"gp":1}},"equipped":{"carryType":"held","invested":null,"handsHeld":2},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"","img":"","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"held-in-two-hands"},"category":"martial","group":"spear","bonus":{"value":0},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d8","damageType":"piercing","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":null},"strikingRune":{"value":""},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":""},"propertyRune2":{"value":""},"propertyRune3":{"value":""},"propertyRune4":{"value":""},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":""}},"type":"weapon","effects":[],"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"urkJDAyWOlhfr4ST","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.LJdbVTOZog39EEbi"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/longsword.webp","name":"Longsword","sort":200000,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Longswords can be one‑edged or two‑edged swords.

They flit about on iridescent butterfly wings, the coloring of which changes based on where they live, giving them a natural camouflage. Unlike their larger kin, an adult faerie dragon remains the same size throughout its lifespan. The only visual clue to the age of a faerie dragon is the sheen on its scales, a glimmer that becomes more lustrous the older it gets.</p>\n<p>Faerie dragons usually exhibit pleasant and good-natured temperaments, though they have a mischievous streak that leads them to play tricks on those around them. In search of an amusement, they prefer harmless annoyances to wounding malice. While often spontaneous, they may also spend months if not years planning the perfect prank. Especially responsive targets endear themselves to faerie dragons and may create a lifelong bond. A faerie dragon's reputation as a trickster leads many to associate them with fey, with whom the tiny dragons have cordial relationships.</p>\n<p>Peaceful by nature, faerie dragons do not enjoy confrontation. If faced with hostility, they prefer to remain at a distance and breathe euphoric gas at their foes, diffusing the skirmish by creating an atmosphere of bliss. If conflict escalates, they target their opponents with spells, using their renowned trickery to escape. If their companions are in danger, however, their desire to remain out of combat changes. Faerie dragons protect their friends by any means available, including physical combat.</p>\n<p>Sometimes as faerie dragons grow older, their connection to the First World grows stronger. In addition to growing more lustrous and vibrant in appearance, these faerie dragons gain an increasing amount of magical primal power. Such faerie dragons increase in strength as appropriate-a faerie dragon of 20th level or even higher is possible, but it is exceptionally unusual to encounter a faerie dragon of 9th level or higher beyond the most remote regions of the First World. When creating a more powerful faerie dragon, change its tradition to primal and grant it a number of primal spells known appropriate for a druid of its level. Faerie dragons don't grow much larger, regardless of how powerful they become. Those who would seek to torment or vex a faerie dragon would do well to consider this, as it's often difficult to tell how powerful one of these tiny dragons truly is at a simple

That the king wasn't very supportive of art styles and pursuits he didn't enjoy never even registered in Tartuccio's mind, as his tastes were so similar.</p>\n<p>And so Tartuccio set into motion plans to catch the king's attention, so as to become first his student, then his trusted advisor, and in time his replacement. He even went as far as to seek out, research, and learn a potent magical technique that allowed him to change shape, intending to use this newfound supernatural power to adjust his appearance to be something more pleasing to the king's eye when the time came to petition to become his student.

Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the forest.

Satyrs are always male.</p>\n<p>The untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr.

When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above-at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname \"landshark.\"</p>\n<p>A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life-a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.</p>\n<p>The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf-a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette's path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.826,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.CzxQpB3p0d9hwPeR"}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ISBIyuMkNnXbaRpd":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677237777853,"modifiedTime":1677237949863,"lastModifiedBy":"ISBIyuMkNnXbaRpd"},"folder":"c3GgvOIer2diwLFO","sort":400000,"_id":"xaAZkywqiwtev19t"},{"prototypeToken":{"displayName":30,"displayBars":50,"flags":{"barbrawl":{"resourceBars":{"bar1":{"order":0,"id":"bar1","attribute":"attributes.hp","mincolor":"#FF0000","maxcolor":"#80FF00","position":"bottom-inner","otherVisibility":50,"ownerVisibility":50,"gmVisibility":-1,"hideFull":false,"hideEmpty":false,"hideCombat":false,"hideNoCombat":true,"indentLeft":null,"indentRight":null,"shareHeight":false,"style":"none","label":"","invert":false,"subdivisions":null,"subdivisionsOwner":false,"fgImage":"","bgImage":"","opacity":null}}},"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true,"autoscale":false}},"name":"Hill Giant","actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/bestiary-tokens/humanoid/giant/hill-giant.webp","scaleX":1.5,"scaleY":1.5,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"randomImg":false},"img":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/bestiary-portraits/humanoid/unique/munguk.webp","items":[{"_id":"YJR2VSzinZXYbwkd","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.kdGqnqbrwPzQfTsm"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/greatclub.webp","name":"Greatclub","sort":100000,"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>While many greatclubs are intricately carved, others are little more than a sturdy tree branch.

Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.

In smaller groups, the hobgoblin archer also serves as that band's captain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hobgoblins may appear to outsiders to be the most civilized of goblinkind, but their civilization is hardly one of kindness and equality-instead, they revel in all that is militaristic, tyrannical, cruel, and destructive. Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin.</p>\n<p>Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they're fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes is an individual hobgoblin's best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society-blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like-know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier.

They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll's endless hunger drives it to consume all variety of living creatures, and it is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls' legendary regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls' capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand-a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures' power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll's vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though-even the smallest scrap of a troll's flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster's entire body until nothing remains.</p>\n<p>Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \"troll kings\" possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll.

Requiring vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds' keen sense of smell to aid in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating contagion known as bloodfire fever. Creatures that contract the disease through the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.</p>\n<p>Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts don't recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed.</p>\n<p>While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into a significant threat to the countryside.

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.</p>\n<p>Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for-or perhaps to summon-intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.</p>\n<p>Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \"spore mounds,\" discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat.

More and more of the townsfolk gather to hear him talk and, as the days wear on, he builds a wellspring of support among the disaffected settlers in the town. Every decision the PCs make has a winner and a loser, and Grigori is gifted at shifting focus to the losers in these decisions and riling them up. Whether it is appealing to the citizens who didn't get what they wanted when the PCs built a new city block, to spinning a narrative that paints a recent event in the most horrid light for those for whom the outcome was a negative, a properly played Grigori should become a constant barb in the players' side and one of the most memorable villains they encounter.
